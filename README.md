# Nand2Tetris Hardware Simulator

## Overview

This project involves testing hardware description language (HDL) files using the Nand2Tetris hardware simulator. The simulator allows you to load and test various HDL chips and verify their functionality.

## Files

- **HDL Files:**
  - `And.hdl`: HDL description for the AND gate chip.
  - `Xor.hdl`: HDL description for the XOR gate chip.

- **Test Scripts:**
  - `And.tst`: Test script for verifying the functionality of the AND gate chip.
  - `Xor.tst`: Test script for verifying the functionality of the XOR gate chip.

## Prerequisites

- **Nand2Tetris Hardware Simulator**: Ensure you have the Nand2Tetris hardware simulator installed. You can download it from the [Nand2Tetris website](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).

## Steps to Run Tests

1. **Open the Hardware Simulator:**
   - Launch the Nand2Tetris hardware simulator application on your computer.

2. **Load the HDL Chip:**
   - Click on the "Load HDL" button or select the corresponding menu option in the simulator.
   - Navigate to the `nand2tetris/Projects/01` directory.
   - Select `And.hdl` to load the HDL file for the AND gate.
   - Repeat this step to load `Xor.hdl` for the XOR gate.

3. **Load the Test Script:**
   - Click on the "Load Script" button or select the corresponding menu option in the simulator.
   - Navigate to the `nand2tetris/Projects/01` directory.
   - Select `And.tst` to load the test script for the AND gate.
   - Repeat this step to load `Xor.tst` for the XOR gate.

4. **Run the Test:**
   - After loading the HDL files and test scripts, click on the "Run" button or select the equivalent option to execute the tests.
   - Observe the outputs to verify the functionality of the HDL chips.

## Notes

- Ensure that the paths to the HDL and test script files are correct.
- The simulator will provide detailed output regarding the success or failure of the tests.
- Refer to the Nand2Tetris documentation for additional information on using the hardware simulator.

## Troubleshooting

- **File Not Found Error:** Verify that the paths to the HDL and test script files are correct.
- **Simulation Errors:** Check the HDL code for syntax errors or logical issues.
